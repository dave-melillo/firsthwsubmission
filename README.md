## Overview and Origin

The company was funded in May 2013 by Zach Perret (right) and William Hockey (left).

Perret and Hockey began their careers at Bain Consulting. While at the company, they noticed that the financial system and many of their components were outdated and inefficient. They both started working on side projects and eventually left the company to join startups. In the process, they built an app called Rambler which let users track their bank transactions on a map layout. They quickly realized that extracting data from banks was particularly difficult which led them to focus on building the infrastructure that would facilitate these issues. This was the lightbulb moment for them and as a result Plaid was born. Instead of working on the app, they worked on the backend technology that allows them to extract bank data from users in real time. In late 2013, they started their seed funding at  $2.8 million from Spark Capital. By the time they had reached their Series C funding, they had landed a $44 million round from Goldman Sachs investment partners. 

## Plaidâ€™s Business Activities:

* Plaid is the technological infrastructure that allows fintechs to communicate with banks in real time. Before Plaid, banks and third party applications would use micro-transactions and written confirmations in order to authenticate transactions. Plaid uses the login credentials from consumers to connect directly to their bank accounts. They can safely and privately extract key information like balances or recent transactions through the login credentials of the consumer.  

* The company targets their products towards developers in the fintech space or any company that deals with financial transactions. Plaid is not a SaaS (software as a service), it is a platform that is mostly embedded in the code of already existing applications. The regular consumer does not use the platform directly. In fact, Plaid is currently the backend infrastructure for many large fintech companies, Venmo, Betterment, TrueBill, Samsung, Chime and many others. Consumers use it everyday and may not even realize. Market size is virtually unlimited at the moment since there are so many fintechs popping up.


* The technology behind Plaid is an API (application programming interface). Getting started with the Plaid API does not take very long and all the details can be found at their [Github repository](https://github.com/plaid/quickstart)

## Landscape:

* Plaid is essentially banking integration API company. As mentioned before, the company is not Saas but instead offers a platform where transactions can be performed. The company makes money not from the consumer (everyday people), but through the amount of transactions it handles. Plaid charges their partners in tiers depending on transaction volume. 

* Financial services API may vary widely. The main three are: payment processing API's, banking integration and identification API's and stock trading API's. The key aspect that sets Plaid apart is their back end infrastructure. Companies like Venmo do not have to worry about the code they need in order to connect to the customer's bank account. Plaid handles this for them. Venmo now just worries about expanding their consumer base. This is good for Plaid because they will be able to handle more transaction volume if Venmo expands. If their partner is doing well, so will they. This is true for all their partners. 

* There are few other players in the space; Galileo Financial Technologies, Akoya, Finicity, SynapseFI, MX, N26, Codat, Xignite and Varo Money. Most of these do not have the kind of market share as Plaid.

## Results

* The impact Plaid has had over the fintech space is tremendous. As of April 2021, the company is valued at around [$13 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/plaid-hits-13point4-billion-valuation-in-the-wake-of-scrapped-visa-deal.html). More and more fintech apps are adopting their payment infrastructure. It is a key component in the fintech space. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/fintech-start-up-plaid-to-buy-competitor-quovo-for-200-million-in-its-first-major-deal.html), Plaid already links a quarter of all U.S. bank accounts to popular fintech apps like Venmo.

* There is a large amount of data that passes through the platform everyday. Some key metrics could be, account balances, recent transactions, login credentials, customer information, location, demographics etc. 

* Relative to the domain, Plaid has sizable market share. It's hard to compare since the fintechs may specialize in different kinds of API's that handle a variety of tasks. Some companies may use Plaid for a specific product and may use competitors for a different service. According to Investopedia, Plaid is currently used by [4,500](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-plaid-5207625) companies. It is important to reference the acquisition activity of the company to paint a better picture of the domain. In January 2019 Plaid bought [Quovo](https://www.businessinsider.com/plaid-acquires-quovo-2019-1), a very similar API platform that mainly dealt in the brokerage and investment space. This acquisition would allow them to expand their services outside the commercial space and into wealth management. In January of 2020, Plaid had announced an [official agreement](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/13/visa-to-acquire-plaid-the-fintech-powering-venmo-and-other-banking-apps-for-5point3-billion.html) with Visa, Inc. Visa would acquire the company for $5.3 billion dollars, compared to their current $2.6 billion dollar valuation. In November of the same year, the United States Department of Justice filed a [lawsuit](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-block-visas-proposed-acquisition-plaid) against the acquisition deeming Visa's behavior to be monopolistic. One year after Plaid's official announcement, Plaid officially canceled the contract with Visa. In January of this 2022, Plaid bought [Cognito](https://plaid.com/blog/cognito-joins-plaid/) which dealt with consumer identity verification which also runs on an API. Plaid saw this as an opportunity to expand their API services. 

## Recommendations

* Plaid could potentially offer their own payment service. At the moment, they only sell to developers and product managers. They do not engage with the average consumer. Since they already have the infrastructure, they could create their own app and enter the payment services market. I think this would benefit the company because half of the work is already done. They could hire developers to work on their app which would already be working with their back end infrastructure.
